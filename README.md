navbar pages

I created several tags for our final project. 
within yuhan's main page, there are several options to redirect page to other designated places (educator, themes, museum) either on left side or the navbar choices (about, playground). 

i try to create links that enables the link to the new page. yuhan still working on her part, therefore, i created a index.html to help me better exam my tags

for the app.tag, i intentionally leave it blank because yuhan and I havent integrated our project yet.

for the list.tag, i created a museum list, which uses a filterable table, would assist student in finding the correct museum using exact word search or the partial to do the job. as the museum list expand, the filterable table will be a much effcient tool. 

on left side of the page, there s a social media navbar  . 5 different icons represents various social media categories, and  the setting enables change once the curser moved to the icon, the color changes, and a click will redirect the page to the designated social media website. i intend to have this function repeatedly usable in every webpage we go. 

for the about.tag, just simple general information. 
i tried to use a bootstrap template, but it did not fit so well with the page. 

for the educator tag, this is a more of a page that helps the interconnected part, i ll probably integrate educator tag along with the contact.tag.  
yuhan is really into pokemon go recently, that's why i placed these two temporary photos 

the last one is the contact.tag. i tried to create a feedback session, or a online qualtrics. 
my initial thought was to integrated class demo 0.1.5 with mail-app, i want to created a up-to-date review session. 
as i recall, the mail-app function will gather all the information and listed, 
and the demo0.1.5 is a more of UI page, the answer changes once the user make a choice. 
i am still working on it.
